# Kouyin 

Kouyin is an experimental library for detecting pitch-accent in audio.

## Building 

The intended environment for Akusento is to run in the browser as part of a larger suite of tools. 
This project is thus oriented to target WASM. `wasm-pack` is necessary to build this project:

```bash
$ cargo install wasm-pack
```
